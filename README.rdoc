# Crossroads 

## Crossroads is a simple to use web app designed to find the midpoint between two distinct starting locations, allowing the user to select a search radius around the midpoint, and a desired activity (like dining, or seeing a movie) within in the search radius. Using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and the Google Maps API, developers Alana Farkas, Leo Kukhar, Bobby Reith, and Ayaz Uddin created the app so that two friends can quickly find the most convenient spot to meet so that the fun can happen faster. Enjoy!

## Coming Soon
1. Calculating a midpoint between 3 or more users
2. Users can add 'favorite' places to their account
3. Integrating Google Places API for the most up-to-date establishment information
