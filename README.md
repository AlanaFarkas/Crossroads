# Crossroads 

Crossroads is a simple to use web app designed to find the midpoint between two distinct starting locations, allowing users to select a search radius around the midpoint, and a desired activity (like dining, or seeing a movie) within the search radius. Using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Foundation Frameworks, and the Google Maps API, developers [Alana Farkas](https://github.com/AlanaFarkas), [Leo Kukhar](https://github.com/leokukhar), [Robert Reith](https://github.com/robertreith), and [Ayaz Uddin](https://github.com/Ayaz2589) created the app so that two friends can quickly find the most convenient spot to meet so that the fun can happen faster. Enjoy!

Note that our app works across all browsers, but looks best in mobile view.

##**Coming Soon**
1. Calculating a midpoint between 2 users
2. Users can also sign in with Google Authentication. ** We will be adding new features in the future **
3. Integrating Google Places API for the most up-to-date establishment information
